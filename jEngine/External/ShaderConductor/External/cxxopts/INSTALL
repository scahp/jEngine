== System installation ==

This library is header only. So you can either copy `include/cxxopts.hpp` to `/usr/include` or `/usr/local/include`, or add `include` to your search path.

== Building the examples and tests ==

It is preferable to build out of source.

cmake ${CXXOPTS_DIR}
make

You can use another build tool, such as ninja.

cmake -G Ninja ${CXXOPTS_DIR}
ninja


To run the tests, run `make test`.
